## **How can you use Flex to make a two-dimensional layout?**

By setting the flex container's `flex-wrap` property to `wrap` and letting items wrap on the new line.

## **Why was CSS Grid introduced?**

To make the creation of a two dimensional layout easier.

## **Which CSS layout module would you use to easily make equal sized items in a container?**

I could use a flex container and give an equal value to the `flex` property of every item inside of it, but grid would allow me to explicitly set every item size, making the result more predictable.
