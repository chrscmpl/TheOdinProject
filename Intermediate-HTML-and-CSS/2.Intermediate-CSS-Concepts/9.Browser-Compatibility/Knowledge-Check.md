## **How are mobile browsers different on Apple mobile operating systems from Android?**

Apple doesn't allow other browsers to be published on their app store, so the iOS versions of other browsers actually use the Safari rendering engine called **WebKit**. They may provide different additional features but the actual browser part is similar to a skinned version of Safari.
