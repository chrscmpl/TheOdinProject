## **What are the four CSS math functions we covered above?**

- `calc()` calculates the result of an expression.
- `min()` returns the smallest of two or more values.
- `max()` returns the greatest of two or more values.
- `clamp()` sets a minimum value, an ideal value on which to base calculations, and a maximum value.

## **How do we use CSS math functions in our CSS?**

We can use them on the right side of properties accepting numerical values, giving them comma separated arguments, on which we can use basic mathematical operators.

## **How can CSS functions help make websites and applications more responsive?**

We can better define how values scale relative to the viewport and other variables. We can have elements take up all the space available on smaller devices and only a part of the space available on desktops, we can make elements or text shrink as the viewport gets smaller but set a minimum size, and more.
