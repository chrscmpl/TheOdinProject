## **What are the three stages in the problem solving process?**

- Understanding the problem.
- Planning, by writing pseudocode.
- Dividing the problem into smaller pieces iteratively.

---

## **Why is it important to clearly understand the problem first?**

Because rushing to solve it will only be a waste of time.

---

## **What can you do to help get a clearer understanding of the problem?**

Writing it in pseudocode or explaining it to someone.

---

## **What are some of the things you should do in the planning stage of the problem solving process?**

Consider the user interface, the inputs, and outputs I want and finally the logic that will turn the inputs into outputs.

---

## **What is an algorithm?**

It defines the steps needed to solve a particular problem.

---

## **What is pseudocode?**

An abstraction of coding not dependant on any specific language that you can use to plan the logic of your program first without thinking about the implementation and language specific details.

---

## **What are the advantages of breaking a problem down and solving the smaller problems?**

It makes big problems much easier to understand.
