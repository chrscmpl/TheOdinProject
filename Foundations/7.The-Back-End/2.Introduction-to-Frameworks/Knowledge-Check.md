## **What problems do frameworks solve?**

They simplify common tasks that every website needs to perform. **Back end** frameworks provide more abstract ways to handle HTTP requests and responses, URL mapping, database access, whose abstraction layer is referred to as Object-Relational Mapper (ORM), which brings independence from the kind of database used and basic validation of data. Backend frameworks also provide templating systems to generate HTML and other kinds of files.

**Front end** frameworks also provide common structure and components so that developers don't need to build every basic components from scratch for every new website.

**User Interface** frameworks simplify the process of stylizing a webpage using CSS.
